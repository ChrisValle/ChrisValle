My name is Chris and I am a New York City native living and working in Sweden.  I am a driven Developer Advocate proficient in growing communities by sharing knowledge, developing content and organizing events.  

Driven by my lifelong interest in tech, I decided to make a career change from HR to Software Development.  After graduating from Thinkful Full-Stack bootcamp in 2018, I started working as a Frontend Dev at the beginning of 2019 and haven't looked back since.

I currently work at Ignite as a Developer Advocate helping grow the Web3 community, a space I am very passionate about.  

In my free time I enjoy spending time with my family, playing poker, working out and exploring new cities.
