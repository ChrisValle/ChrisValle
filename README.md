### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Chris and I am a New York City native living and working in Sweden.  I am a driven Software Developer proficient in modern Python on the backend as well as proven experience with JavaScript OOP with React on the frontend.  I am particularly interested in AWS and have official AWS Solutions Architect, Developer and SysOps certifications.

Driven by my lifelong interest in tech, I decided to make a career change from HR to Software Development.  After graduating from Thinkful Full-Stack bootcamp in 2018, I started working as a Frontend Dev at the beginning of 2019 and haven't looked back since.

I currently work at Funnel as a Software Engineer building API connectors and helping marketing analysts get their marketing data from across different platforms business-ready.  On the side I am learning about Solidity and Web3 development.  

Teach Stack: Python, AWS, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Git, Grafana, Solidity, Web3, Blockchain, Sentry, Firebase and LogDNA.

In my free time I enjoy spending time with my family, playing poker, working out and exploring new cities.
